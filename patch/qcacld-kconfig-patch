Subject: [PATCH] qcacld-3.0: Add missing WLAN_FEATURE_FILS Kconfig

We need to be able to toggle WLAN_FEATURE_FILS in the defconfig in order
to compile qcacld-3.0 successfully. CAF missed out on this because they
build boot images, which is not affected by this problem due to the
way WLAN_FEATURE_FILS is automatically enabled by Kbuild.
